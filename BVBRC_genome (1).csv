Carbapenems are considered a last-resort antibiotic, however the spread of plasmid-encoded carbapenemases such as the New-Delhi Metallo-beta-Lactamase (blaNDM-1) challenges their effectiveness. E. coli ST101 is an emerging, atypical multidrug resistant ExPEC lineage, highly associated with the carriage of blaNDM-1. In this study we analysed the phylogeny and antimicrobial resistance of ST101 isolates from the UK and India.","2020-07-01T18:19:37.231Z","2020-07-01T18:19:37.231Z"

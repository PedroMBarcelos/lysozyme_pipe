These isolates were initially identified as Hafnia alvei, but further analysis showed that they were more closely related to Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri, and subsequently reclassified as E. albertii in 2003. E. albertii produces intimin, a virulence factor characteristic for enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strains. However, its pathogenic potential is currently unknown and it is unclear how common is this new species in food and clinical samples. In addition, its identification is difficult because of the lack of biochemical tests, and exclusively based on molecular methods (e.g. PCR).The project will provide a platform to identify new genes that may contribute to this pathogen's virulence or markers usefull in reliable identification of E. albertii strains. Moreover, it can expand our knowledge about genomic variability, plasticity and mechanisms of evolution of enteropathogenic Escherichia spp. strains.","2014-12-08T22:11:18.855Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

PBT2 was observed to resensitize Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to last-resort polymyxin class antibiotics, including the less-toxic next-generation polymyxin derivative, FADDI-287.

Using a highly invasive K. pneumoniae strain engineered for polymyxin resistance through mgrB mutation, we successfully demonstrated the efficacy of PBT2 + FADDI-287 in vivo for the treatment of Gram-negative sepsis.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of mcr-1 mediated colistin resistance gene in fecal samples of patients attending a tertiary care hospital. From November 2014 until July 2015, fecal samples of patients attending the Leiden University Medical Center were collected and retrospectively screened for presence of mcr-1 using real-time PCR. Two of 576 patients were positive for mcr-1, resulting in a prevalence of 0.35%. One sample contained an ESBL negative, AmpC positive and mcr-1 (located on an IncX4 plasmid) containing E.coli. This strain belonged to Sequence Type 359 and serotype O177:H21. The mcr-1 containing E.coli was phenotypically susceptible to colistin with a MIC of ≤ 0.25mg/L, due to a 1329bp transposon IS10R inserted into the mcr-1 gene.","2016-09-11T16:31:47.500Z","2016-09-11T16:31:47.500Z"

One such factor is the polysaccharide K capsule, which provides protection against host innate immune factors. Among the different K capsule types, the K1 serotype is strongly associated with UPEC strains that cause UTI, bloodstream infections and meningitis. In this study, we employed a combination of a lytic K1 capsule-specific phage, saturated Tn5 transposon mutagenesis, and high-throughput transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) to identify genes associated with K1 capsule production in the clinical urosepsis isolate PA45B.","2017-09-28T21:52:15.495Z","2017-09-28T21:52:15.495Z"

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","2018-05-26T01:14:33.083Z","2018-05-26T01:14:33.083Z"

Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is the most commonly identified carbapenemase in the U.S. and is frequently found on mobile genetic elements including plasmids, which can be horizontally transmitted between bacteria of the same or different species. Here we describe the results of an epidemiological investigation of KPC-producing bacteria at two healthcare facilities. Using a combination of short-read and long-read whole-genome sequencing, we identified an identical 44 kilobase plasmid carrying the blaKPC-2 gene in four bacterial isolates belonging to three different species (Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli). The isolates in this investigation were collected from patients who were epidemiologically linked in a region in which KPC was uncommon, suggesting that the antibiotic resistance plasmid was transmitted between these bacterial species. This investigation highlights the importance of long-read sequencing in investigating the relatedness of bacterial plasmids, and in elucidating potential plasmid-mediated outbreaks caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria.","2020-08-22T12:41:36.367Z","2020-08-22T12:41:36.367Z"

In this context, phage therapy, by using bacteriophages which specifically infect to bacteria, has been received significant attention as an alternative approach to classical antibiotic therapy. On the other hand, further understandings of interaction between bacteria and phages are required to develop phage therapy because bacteria can acquire phage-resistance in the therapy. To investigate mechanisms underlying phage infection to the host and identify the receptors, whole genome information is necessary.

Previously published short-read DNA sequence of pMG101 showed that it was a 183.5 Kb IncHI plasmid, where a Tn7-mediated transposition of pco/sil resistance genes into the chromosome of the E. coli K-12 J53 host strain had occurred. We noticed differences in streptomycin resistance and plasmid size between two stocks of E. coli K-12 J53 pMG101 we possessed, which we had obtained from two different laboratories. We sequenced the strains to identify whether they were in fact identical. Long-read sequencing (PacBio) of the two strains shows significant differences between them. pMG101-A is a non-transmissible 383 Kb closed-circular plasmid consisting of an IncHI2 plasmid sequence fused to an IncFI/FIIA plasmid. pMG101-B is a mobile closed-circular 168 Kb IncFI/FIIA plasmid. Sequence identity of pMG101-B with the fused IncFI/IncFIIA region of pMG101-A was >99%. Assembled host sequence reads of pMG101-B showed Tn7-mediated transposition of pco/sil into the E. coli J53 chromosome between yhiM and yhiN. Long read sequence data in combination with laboratory experiments has demonstrated large scale changes in pMG101, loss of resistance and conjugation function, and movement of resistance genes into the chromosome- similar to plasmid variations seen in recently isolated plasmids- suggesting that changes in the plasmids in the laboratory strains are similar to those that occur naturally. This study emphasises the importance of utilising long read sequencing technologies of plasmids and host strains at the earliest opportunity.","2021-06-03T04:08:28.847Z","2021-06-03T04:08:28.847Z"

ExPEC produce multiple virulence factors that contribute to host colonisation and infection, including adhesins from the chaperone-usher fimbriae class. ExPEC Ucl fimbriae mediate attachment to human exfoliated uroepithelial cells, biofilm formation and intestinal colonization. Here, we show that the ucl fimbrial genes are predominantly found in ExPEC strains from the B2 phylogeny. Genome editing of representative strains from two common sequence types, F11 (ST127) and UTI89 (ST95), identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in the ucl promoter region that increases Ucl fimbrial expression via activation by the global regulator OxyR, leading to enhanced colonisation of the mouse gut. We determined the glycan receptor repertoire and crystal structure of the UclD lectin domain, as well as the homologous UcaD fimbrial adhesin from Proteus mirabilis. Despite their conserved tertiary structure, glycan array analysis showed both adhesins recognise different oligosaccharides. Structural analyses of UcaD in complex with monosaccharides revealed a glycan binding pocket, providing a framework for the development of novel anti-adhesion drugs","2021-06-26T02:43:16.753Z","2021-06-26T02:43:16.753Z"

It is frequently associated with antimicrobial resistance to several drug classes, including to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often attributable to the presence of CTX-M genes encoding extended spectrum beta-lactamases. This study used whole genome sequencing to characterize the evolutionary history of the lineage as it has emerged and spread worldwide, and to explain the genetic context of the CTX-M genes. In order to do this, several DH10B E. coli isolates were transformed with extracted CTX-M plasmids, then sequenced, enabling an approximate reconstruction of the plasmid sequences by bioinformatically removing DH10B-associated reads and undertaking de novo assembly of the residual data.","2016-01-31T09:05:39.835Z","2016-01-31T09:05:39.835Z"

Drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has been one of the most important nosocomial pathogens with the highest incidence rate of isolation among Acinetobacter species. The genus Acinetobacter composes 62 distinct species with validly published names and several species with effectively published names awaiting validation. Acinetobacter variabilis was originally classified as Acinetobacter DNA group 15 TU using DNA-DNA hybridization by Tjernberg and Ursing in 1989. Later, Acinetobacter DNA group 15 TU was proposed as Acinetobacter variabilis sp. nov. in 2015 by Krizova L., et al. Since NDM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli was initially detected in 2008 in Sweden, NDM-type MBL producers have become endemic in the India, and these organisms were isolated in various countries and regions worldwide. Although NDM-type MBL producers seem to be not yet spreading in Japan, there is at least four reports of NDM producing clinical isolates, including an isolate of E. coli producing NDM-1 MBL obtained from a patient traveling India for business in March 2009, and two isolates of NDM-5 MBL producing E. coli and NDM-1 MBL producing K. pneumoniae obtained from two foreigners from Bangladesh and Indonesia, respectively, and an isolate of E. coli producing NDM-7 obtained from a patient with history of admission in India. In Acinetobacter species, an isolate of NDM-1 MBL producing A. baumannii was obtained from a patient in Japan. The methylation of 16S rRNA confers high resistance to all clinically important aminoglycosides in Gram-negative organism. Clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae harboring the armA, a 16S rRNA methylase, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring the rmtA, another one, were identified in 2003 in France, Japan, and the other countries since 2003. To date, 10 plasmid-associated 16S rRNA methylase genes, armA, rmtA-H and npmA, have been identified in human and animal. In this study, we analysis a clinical isolate of A. variabilis producing both NDM-1 MBL and OXA-420 carbapenemases, and ArmA 16S rRNA methylase obtained from a patient in Japan.","2021-06-03T04:04:35.110Z","2021-06-03T04:04:35.110Z"
